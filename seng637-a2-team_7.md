# 1 Introduction

To increase our knowledge of software testing (and Java in particular), we are looking at Junit testing. This is a common technique to test Java code using the built-in functionality. The JFreeChart .jar files were provided for this assignment, and will be used as example classes for testing. 

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

Text…

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
